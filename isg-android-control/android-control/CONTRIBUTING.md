- Build once locally: `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
- Run checks: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lint ktlintCheck detekt`.

## Branching

- Describe behavior/impact; include screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- Note tests added/updated and any coverage considerations.
- Update docs when behavior or public APIs change.

## Pre-Push Checklist
- `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` passes; add tests for new logic.
- Static analysis clean: `./gradlew lint ktlintCheck detekt`.
- Build succeeds: `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
- No secrets committed; review `.gitignore` and configs.

## Where Things Live
- App code: `app/`.
- Shared logic: `modules/core/`.
- Device control/ADB: `modules/device/`.
- Scripts: `scripts/`; Tests resources: `tests/`; Docs: `docs/`.
